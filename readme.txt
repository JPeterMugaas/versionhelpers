This is just the obligitory readme file.

The files included are listed below:

IdCompilerDefines.inc - Include file from Indy that I use with this header.  I am too lazy to pare this down for inclusion with this package.
versionhelpers.pas - translation of VersionHelpers.h from the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8.1  This also includes a defintion for IsWow64Process to provide support for that API function in old Delphi versions and for older operating systems.
LICENSE.TXT - the license file for this translation.
readme.txt - this file

Am explation for this is provided on my website ( http://jpetermugaas.com/getversionex.html ).   If you need help, just look at Microsoft's Documentation and the header file itself.

Share and Enjoy.
